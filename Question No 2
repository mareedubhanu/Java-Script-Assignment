Write a JavaScript for a loop that will iterate from n times. For eachiteration, it will check if the current number is odd, even or prime, anddisplay a message on the screen.

Code:-

for (var x=0; x<=4; x++) {
        if (x === 0) {
                console.log(x +  " is even");
        }
        else if (x % 2 === 0) {
                console.log(x + " is even");   
        }
        else {
                console.log(x + " is odd");
        }
}     

Output:-
a."0 is even"
b."1 is odd"
c."2 is even and prime"
d.“3 is odd and prime”
e.“4 is even”
